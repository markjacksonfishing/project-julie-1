## Project Julie: Thyroid Cancer Detection with Computer Vision on Kubernetes

Project Julie is a research project aimed at increasing cancer diagnosis accuracy using computer vision and machine learning techniques, specifically for thyroid cancer detection. Our solution leverages Kubernetes for scalability and ease of deployment.

### Overview

We have developed a machine learning model that analyzes CT scans for possible thyroid cancer. The model compares input scans to a large dataset of images and produces a probability rating percentage of the high probability of it being cancerous. The project follows the below steps:

1. Data collection
2. Data preprocessing
3. Labeling
4. Model selection
5. Model training
6. Model evaluation
7. Deployment
8. Continuous improvement

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* TensorFlow 2.x
* Keras
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Docker (for Kubernetes deployment)
* Kubernetes manifest
